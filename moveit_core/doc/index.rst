moveit_core python
=======================================

.. note::
    These docs are autogenerated. Whenever you see the py prefix, you can ignore it.
    For example, you should write ``import moveit_core`` instead of ``import pymoveit_core``.
    The latter will work, but will not contain the full API that ``import moveit_core`` does.
